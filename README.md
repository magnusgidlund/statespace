R Package for Bayesian State Models using variance discounting

This package includes functions and helpers for my thesis ”Detecting changes in telecom data using state space models”. This is a continuation of functions available in "dlm" (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dlm) where I added the option for component discounting, i.e using different discount factors to different components in the model.

It is also an implementation of chapter 11, Intervention and Monitoring, in WEST & HARRISON Bayesian forecasting & dynamic models (1997).
